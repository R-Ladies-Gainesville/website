  description: "The Tutorial Series is a project to encourage R-Ladies to document and share their knowledge about R. The tutorials created through this project are available on this website. The 'live' versions are available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/tutorials). We invite you to participate in the Tutorial Series by creating your own tutorial or editing existing ones. The general flow for a tutorial is:\n\n(1) Propose tutorial topic as an R-Ladies Gainesville meeting [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwJSZJ_WiEKMfSivnX4S0Rtum3kAzeQY5uq36Zts6w9OeKAg/viewform)\n\n(2) Collaborate with R-Ladies Gainesville leadership (and anyone else you want) to create a tutorial (see our [template](/blog/tutorial-template) for ideas)\n\n(3) Present the tutorial at an R-Ladies Gainesville meeting to test it out and get feedback\n\n(4) Post your tutorial on GitHub so that R-Ladies everywhere can try it out and make it great!"

It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
